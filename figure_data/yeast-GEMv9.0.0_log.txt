Starting dead-end test...
 - Found 920 dead-end metabolites.
 - Found 1082 reactions incapable of sustaining steady-state fluxes in either direction due to these dead-ends.
 - Found 642 reversible reactions that can only carry steady-state fluxes in a single direction due to dead-ends.
Starting duplicate test...
 - Found 77 reactions that were some type of duplicate:
   - 0 were completely identical to at least one other reaction.
   - 6 involve the same metabolites but go in the opposite direction or have the opposite reversibility as at least one other reaction.
   - 18 involve the same metabolites but with different coefficients as at least one other reaction.
   - 59 redox reactions oxidize and/or reduce the same metabolites as another redox reaction but use a different pair of the given redox carriers.
Starting diphosphate test...
 - Found 57 suspiciously reversible reactions that involve diphosphate.
Starting loop test...
 - Took 0 minute(s) to attempt to get minimum fluxes for 4130 reactions using 16 threads.
 - Took 0 minute(s) to attempt to get maximum fluxes for 4130 reactions using 16 threads.
 - Found 468 reactions involved in infinite loops.
Starting dilution test...
 - Adjusted lower bounds on exchange reactions so that only the 21 given metabolites could be consumed.
 - Finding ranges of possible fluxes for all reactions in model without dilution constraints...
 - Took 0 minute(s) to attempt to get minimum fluxes for 4130 reactions using 16 threads.
 - Took 0 minute(s) to attempt to get maximum fluxes for 4130 reactions using 16 threads.
 - According to FVA results, out of 685 nominally reversible reactions (excluding exchange reactions), 33 could only sustain forward fluxes, 13 could only sustain reverse fluxes, and 16 couldn't sustain fluxes in either direction.
 - Added a "leakage" reaction for all 1002 pairs of metabolites in different compartments that seem to represent the same real-world metabolite and set their bounds to +/- 1.
 - Found 112 metabolites for which adding a dilution constraint prevented fluxes through all associated reactions.
 - Found 621 reactions that are blocked by one or more dilution constraints.
2061 of the 4130 reactions in the given GSMM were flagged by at least one of the tests.
