Starting dead-end test...
 - Found 1313 dead-end metabolites.
 - Found 1085 reactions incapable of sustaining steady-state fluxes in either direction due to these dead-ends.
 - Found 1607 reversible reactions that can only carry steady-state fluxes in a single direction due to dead-ends.
Starting duplicate test...
 - Found 847 reactions that were some type of duplicate:
   - 14 were completely identical to at least one other reaction.
   - 99 involve the same metabolites but go in the opposite direction or have the opposite reversibility as at least one other reaction.
   - 540 involve the same metabolites but with different coefficients as at least one other reaction.
   - 301 redox reactions oxidize and/or reduce the same metabolites as another redox reaction but use a different pair of the given redox carriers.
Starting diphosphate test...
 - Found 185 suspiciously reversible reactions that involve diphosphate.
Starting loop test...
 - Found 2504 reactions involved in infinite loops.
Starting dilution test...
 - Adjusted lower bounds on exchange reactions so that only the 86 given metabolites could be consumed.
 - Encountered errors when testing dilution constraints for 29 metabolites; trying to test them again.
 - Successfully tested all dilution constraints after 2 tries.
 - Found 582 metabolites for which adding a dilution constraint prevented fluxes through all associated reactions.
 - Found 1198 reactions that are blocked by one or more dilution constraints.
4783 of the 13073 reactions in the given GSMM were flagged by at least one of the tests.
