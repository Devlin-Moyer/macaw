Starting dead-end test...
 - Found 1370 dead-end metabolites.
 - Found 1123 reactions incapable of sustaining steady-state fluxes in either direction due to these dead-ends.
 - Found 1594 reversible reactions that can only carry steady-state fluxes in a single direction due to dead-ends.
Starting duplicate test...
 - Found 706 reactions that were some type of duplicate:
   - 0 were completely identical to at least one other reaction.
   - 13 involve the same metabolites but go in the opposite direction or have the opposite reversibility as at least one other reaction.
   - 445 involve the same metabolites but with different coefficients as at least one other reaction.
   - 261 redox reactions oxidize and/or reduce the same metabolites as another redox reaction but use a different pair of the given redox carriers.
Starting diphosphate test...
 - Found 0 suspiciously reversible reactions that involve diphosphate.
Starting loop test...
 - Found 2275 reactions involved in infinite loops.
Starting dilution test...
 - Adjusted lower bounds on exchange reactions so that only the 86 given metabolites could be consumed.
 - Encountered errors when testing dilution constraints for 30 metabolites; trying to test them again.
 - Successfully tested all dilution constraints after 2 tries.
 - Found 547 metabolites for which adding a dilution constraint prevented fluxes through all associated reactions.
 - Found 1127 reactions that are blocked by one or more dilution constraints.
4430 of the 12995 reactions in the given GSMM were flagged by at least one of the tests.
