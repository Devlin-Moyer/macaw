Starting duplicate test...
 - Found 827 reactions that were some type of duplicate:
   - 0 were completely identical to at least one other reaction.
   - 95 involve the same metabolites but go in the opposite direction or have the opposite reversibility as at least one other reaction.
   - 536 involve the same metabolites but with different coefficients as at least one other reaction.
   - 291 redox reactions oxidize and/or reduce the same metabolites as another redox reaction but use a different pair of the given redox carriers.
Starting dead-end test...
 - Found 1227 dead-end metabolites.
 - Found 1029 reactions incapable of sustaining steady-state fluxes in either direction due to these dead-ends.
 - Found 1611 reversible reactions that can only carry steady-state fluxes in a single direction due to dead-ends.
Starting loop test...
 - Found 2499 reactions involved in infinite loops.
Starting dilution test...
 - Adjusted lower bounds on exchange reactions so that only the 86 given metabolites could be consumed.
